        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium-low heat. 
                Add leek and garlic; cook and stir until soft, about 5 minutes. 
                Add rice and cook for 5 minutes more, stirring frequently.
            </li>
            <li>Pour in 1 1/2 cups chicken broth and bring to a boil over high heat, stirring occasionally. 
                Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, uncovered, for 5 minutes, continuing to stir occasionally. 
                Pour in remaining chicken broth and wine; increase heat to medium and cook for about 5 more minutes, stirring constantly.
            </li>
            <li>Add scallops, shrimp, peas, and red pepper. 
                Cook, stirring constantly, until remaining liquid is almost absorbed and seafood has cooked, about 5 minutes. 
                When rice is just tender and slightly creamy, season with Parmesan cheese, basil, lemon juice, and pepper.
            </li>
