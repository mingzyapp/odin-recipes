        <h1>Avocado Toast with eggs</h1>
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>I love avocado toast, and if you add an egg to it you have a full meal. </p>
        <p>I use balsamic vinegar to flavor the avocado instead of the lemon juice.</p>
        <p>You can make the egg any way you like, but I like it best fried or poached.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 teaspoon butter</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>2 slices multigrain bread</li>
            <li>1 ripe avocado, pitted, peeled</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon lemon juice, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>sea salt to taste</li>
            <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt butter in a skillet over medium-low heat. 
                Crack eggs into the skillet side by side and cook until eggs are white on the bottom layer and firm enough to flip, 2 to 3 minutes. 
                Flip eggs, trying not to crack the yolk, and cook until egg reaches desired doneness, 2 to 5 minutes more.
            </li>
            <li>Meanwhile, toast bread slices to desired doneness, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Mash avocado in a bowl; stir in lemon juice, cayenne pepper, and sea salt. 
                Spread avocado mixture onto toast. Top with fried egg and season with sea salt and pepper.
            </li>
        </ol>
